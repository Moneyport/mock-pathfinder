# [DEPRECATED] mock-pathfinder

## Deprecation Notice

The mock-pathfinder service was deprecated as of November 2019. This service is no longer maintained, and is no longer referenced by any releases of Mojaloop.

For a list of active Mojaloop repos, please refer to [Repo Details](https://mojaloop.io/documentation/repositories/) section of the Mojaloop documentation.

## About
A mock PathFinder server for development and testing. 

The server has two different endpoints, one that supports the PathFinder Query API over DNS, and one that supports the PathFinder Provisioning API over SOAP.

The project is intended to fully replace the PathFinder service with a local version for testing and development purposes. It is not intended to be a replacement for production usage.

## Deployment

To run the server locally outside of Docker, run the command `npm start` from the command line. This will start the service and open two ports, 15353 over UDP and 8080 over TCP.

### Deploy to Docker

To run the server in your local Docker environment, run the command `npm run dev` to build and run the container. This will start the service in Docker and open two ports, 15353 over UDP and 8080 over TCP.

## Configuration

### Environment variables
